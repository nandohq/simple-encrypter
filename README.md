![screenshot](/assets/images/screen.jpg)

This little app is a simple vowel encrypter to shuffle messages. It will override the vowels by specific words to turn the message unredable. The rules for the override is the following:


| VOGAL | SUBSTITUTE |
|-------|------------|
|   a   |     ai     |
|   e   |    enter   |
|   i   |    imes    |
|   o   |    ober    |
|   u   |    ufat    |


Fill the field with the word that you want encrypt or decrypt and press the correct button.
If you need to use the generated word, press the arrow up button to avoid use CTRL+C/CTRL+V.
